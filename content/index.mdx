title: 'selo.pona.la: a starter for Toki Pona sites'
description: 'Start modifying this page to your needs!'
---

* Do you want to create a new statically built website?
* Is it going to be mostly Markdown text, with a little bit of functionality sprinkled in?
* Should it visually fit alongside other sites made by the Toki Pona community?

**If so, this starter is for you!**

We provide two repositories:
* The [component library](https://github.com/pona-la/selo-components/), which implements common parts so that you don't have to.
* The [demo](https://github.com/pona-la/selo.pona.la/) (you're here!), which is an already working site you can start tinkering with!

## How to use
### Starting out
* Create a repository using the starter: \
  `npm create astro@latest -- --template pona-la/selo.pona.la`
* Decide on a domain name.
* Rename your package in `package.json`.
* Check out `src/config.json`: it contains site-wide strings and settings you can tweak.
* Enable Github Pages in your repository. Specify the domain name.
* Add your site to [Goatcounter](https://goatcounter.com/)! It's privacy-respecting enough for the user, while offering useful insight for the site owner.

### Going beyond the starter
* This landing page is found at `content/index.mdx`. Start by rewriting it!
* Add new pages in `content/` -- the URLs will match the directory structure.
  * Use the `slug` variable if you want finer control over URLs!
* Familiarise yourself with `src/` and `public/` -- update them to your needs.
* Use `src/components/` for new components you make.

## Can I get a pona.la subdomain for this?
Generally, yes! But there's an important distinction:
1. If your project is for **personal** use, you can almost certainly get a subdomain at **\<your-toki-pona-name\>.li.pona.la**.
2. If it is for the **community**, you can get a subdomain at **\<your-project-theme\>.pona.la**. Since there are only ~100 such subdomains that use basic Toki Pona words, we have to be a bit strategic about allocating. These projects usually belong to the [pona-la Github organisation](https://github.com/pona-la/) for ease of maintenance, and try to be permanently useful.

To ask for a domain, reach out to [lawa@pona.la](mailto:lawa@pona.la). If you don't get a reply, ask the mods [on Discord](https://discord.gg/mapona)!

## Caveats

The routing currently assumes your site is loaded at the root of your domain. If your site is at `username.github.io/reponame/`, some navigation will likely to be strange or broken. If this bothers you, feel free to contribute!
